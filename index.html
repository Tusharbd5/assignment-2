                            Neymar—a slender-framed 5-foot 9-inch (1.75-metre) forward—was supremely confident on the
                            field, with excellent body control, quick reflexes, and explosive speed. He made his first
                            team debut with Santos in 2009. While playing with Santos, he averaged a goal every other
                            match and helped the team win the Libertadores Cup (the most prestigious South American club
                            competition) in 2011. Neymar’s many individual honours with Santos included the South
                            American Footballer of the Year title in 2011 and 2012.
